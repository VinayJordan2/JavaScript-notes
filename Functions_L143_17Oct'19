#Functions. (The Most important topic in JavaScript)

> Functions let us wrap bits of code up into REUSABLE packages. They are one of the building blocks of JS.

1. Declare a function first:
function doSomething() {
  console.log("HELLO WORLD");
}

2. Then call it:
doSomething();
doSomething();
doSomething();
doSomething();

> Functions help us keep our code 'DRY' (ex: Twinkle Twinkle Little star song code)
