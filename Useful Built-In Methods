(just FYI '//' is used for comments in JS and 'clear()' will clear the JS console)
//alert -> This one pops up an alert for the user
alert("Hello there!!");
alert(22*2);

//console.log -> This is just for us, not the user
console.log("hello from the console!")

//prompt -> It lets us get input from the user
prompt("what is your name?")

ex: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Script Demo</title>
<script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Including JS Files</h1>

</body>
</html>

script.js:
var userName = prompt("What is your name?");
alert ("Nice to meet you, " + userName);
console.log("Also great to meet you, " + userName);
