Arguments:
> Often we want to write functions that take inputs.
funtion square(num) {
  console.log(num * num);
}

> Now when we call 'square', we need to pass in a value.
square(10); //prints 100
square(3); //prints 9
square(4); //prints 16

example:
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log("Hello there " + name + "!");
}

sayHello("Rusty");
output: Hello there Rusty!

> Functions can have as many arguments as needed
function area(length, width) {
  console.log(length * width);
}
area(9, 12); //18

function greet(person1, person2, person3) {
  console.log("hi " + person1);
  console.log("hi " + person2);
  console.log("hi " + person3);
}
greet("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione");

** The ability of the funtions to take in arguments is one of the most important things
** the strings given inside arguments while defining the function is called 'place holders'
** having functions is not just to not have a repeating code but also to be able to change the output based on the input
   and arguments let us do that
